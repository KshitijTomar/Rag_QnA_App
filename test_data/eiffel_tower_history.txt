The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, stands as one of the most recognizable structures in the world. Constructed between 1887 and 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, it was meant to showcase France's technological prowess a century after the French Revolution. Designed by Gustave Eiffel's engineering company, the tower was initially met with skepticism and harsh criticism. Many prominent Parisians, including artists and writers, signed a petition decrying the structure as a 'monstrous' addition to the city. Despite these early controversies, the Eiffel Tower was completed in a record time of two years, two months, and five days, a testament to the ingenuity and efficiency of its design and construction. \n\nStanding at 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, it was the world's tallest man-made structure until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. The tower consists of over 18,000 iron parts and 2.5 million rivets, making it a marvel of 19th-century engineering. Originally intended to be dismantled after 20 years, it was repurposed for scientific experiments, including radio transmission tests, which contributed to its preservation. Over the years, the Eiffel Tower has become a global cultural icon, symbolizing French art, history, and innovation. Today, it is one of the most visited monuments in the world, attracting millions of tourists annually.
